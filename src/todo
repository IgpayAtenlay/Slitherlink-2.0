LOGIC
solving actions, choose which ones to only run once
create threeLoop rule (if there is a loop near a three, the side that would connect it must be a line)

UI
make blind friendly - test with Momom
change "show solution" to toggle temporarily showing the solution like "Check Accuracy" does (have these be mutually exclusive states)
have "check accuracy" auto solve puzzle before showing

REFACTORING

split solving actions into better (and more) classes
clean up guess and check, single block, trapped, util, and visuals
in solving actions, rename coords to make clear whether they are square or point coords

TECH DEBT

add generic "changes" which capture the entire puzzle - for use with reset and items like autosolve steps
make loop successfully track deleted lines
fix loop errors
